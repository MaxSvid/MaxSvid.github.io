### Stocki DeFi 

At the moment, I am developing mainly â€” [Stocki DeFi Agent Community](https://t.me/StockiDeFi_bot). 

In this project, I handle several tasks within my field: 
- programmimg,
- analyzing data, 
- and working on DeFi Research to find the best liquidity pools and yeilds/staking opportunities.

I apply different data analysis and statistical methods as part of a team of 3 people, while working on an AI Agent designed to predict and collect the top 10 DeFi best pools/yeilds each week.

My main interested is exploring how AI can be integrated with DeFi and Blockchain to create new solutions in the decentralized spaces for people as well as creating YouTube videos with easy content.
