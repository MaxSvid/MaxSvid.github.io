# Projects I've been working on over the last years:

## 1. Telegram Bot for private DeFi Web3 group 
[Link Source Code]()
- Designed for new members to buy membership from the bot by paying Solana crypto wallet.

- Worked a lot with Docker(+compose), PostgreSQL and Python. 

- Hosting and running on Google Cloud 24/7.

- Still an ongoing project that I maintain in my spare time from university and part-time job.

- A complete DB has been developed from 0 and performance-based data analysis is used from time to time.
