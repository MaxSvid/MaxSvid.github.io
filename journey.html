        I was born in Odesa, Ukraine, and from the age of six, my life revolved around 
        the basketball court. Following in my father's footsteps, I realized early on that 
        basketball isn't just about the game - it’s about learning how to perform and grow under pressure.

        At 14, I managed to get a scholarship in California to play there, before the 
        COVID-19 eventually transferred me to Wichita, Kansas in 2020. It was there that I took 
        my first programming class which changed the way I approached problem solving.

        While doing my algebra homework, I started writing small Python scripts to automate 
        the process, realizing that logic could save time. It wasn't about avoiding effort, 
        but about finding the fastest way to get results - it was this idea that led me to study Artificial Intelligence.

        After graduation, I gained my first real-world experience as a team intern for <span class="italic">We Are D3</span>, 
        a professional basketball team competing in the $1 million TBT tournament.

      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted mt-6">
        Seeing how things run behind the scenes it taught me that data is the "secret" of sports. It’s the 
        difference between a random guess and a winning strategy.

        While playing college basketball at GCC in Michigan during the 2023/2024 season, I began exploring DeFi because of the idea of ​​financial systems 
        running as open source.
      </p>

      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted mt-6">
        I realized that both AI and DeFi are about the same thing, creating more
        advanced systems that don't rely on old, slow intermediaries.

        After finishing my 1st year of college and studying Computer Programming, I returned to We Are D3 
        in the summer of 2024. I traveled with the team to Dayton, Ohio, to witness the team's first tournament win in six years.

      A summer in Ohio along living and traveling around New England with my family, made my mind: 
      whether this was a winning strategy or a smart contract analysis for a liquidity pool, 
      I wanted to learn more about the science behind it in the rapidly changing world of AI.

      That's why I made the most important decision of my life: to end my basketball career 
      which brought me to the States 7 years ago, and move to Aberdeen to pursue a degree 
      in Data Science with AI at RGU and be closer to my family, who live in the city.

      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted mt-6">
      I want to focus on building something truly important that can benefit people – using AI or 
      machine learning to solve complex problems and exploring the idea of ​​DeFi as the future of data in finance.
