        I was born in Odesa, Ukraine, growing up my life spun around the basketball court. 
        Following in my father's footsteps, I developed a genuine love for this game.
      </p>

      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted mt-6">
        At 14, I managed to get a scholarship in California to play there, before the 
        COVID-19 eventually transferred me to Wichita, Kansas in 2020. It was there that I took 
        my first introduction to programming class.

      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted mt-6">
        While taking this class, I began writing small Python scripts to help myself with basic algebra homework.
        This helped me to save some free time on it and keep up with intensee basketball season and 2 trainings per day. 
        Seeing and learning how computer could handle several tasks more efficiently it sparked my interest in exploring how technology
        and later machine learning and AI can help people work faster or study better.

      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted mt-6">
        After graduation in 2023, I gained my first real-world experience as a team intern for <span class="italic">We Are D3</span>, 
        a professional basketball team competing in the $1 million TBT tournament. 
      </p>

      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted mt-6">
        Seeing how things run behind the scenes allowed me to gain experience in team management and further explore more how data is used
        everywhere in sports by being the "secret" behind the strategy, similar to what is shown in the Moneyball (2011) movie with Brad Pitt and Johan Hill.

      After that summer, I went to play college basketball at GCC in Michigan for NJCAA Region 13 during the 2023/24 season. 
      I then chose to study Computer Programming in Applied Business to dive deeper into the areas that interested me. 
      </p>

      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted mt-6">
      While that year wasn’t the best for basketball, it was definitely a great year for exploring pick of AI and even getting my first introduction to Web3.
      </p>

      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted mt-6">
      After finishing my freshman year of college, I returned to We Are D3 in the summer of 2024. 
      I traveled with the team to Dayton, Ohio, to witness the team's first tournament win in six years.

      A summer in Ohio that year, along with living and traveling around New England with my family, made me 
      realize that I wanted to learn more about the science behind the rapidly changing world of AI 
      and data-driven decisions - the kind that can help people win or improve outcomes.

      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted mt-6">
      That’s why I made the hard decision to end my basketball career in the states, where I had spent nearly seven years of my life, 
      and focus on my new goal. I moved to Aberdeen to pursue a degree in Data Science with Business Management at Robert Gordon University.
    </p>

      <p class="leading-relaxed text-muted mt-6">
      And yeah, I still play and enjoy basketball in my free time here in Scotland, but I’m also exploring an idea 
      I’ve had since my sophomore year of high school - that Machine Learning and AI can be good for people, as long as 
      we make the right decisions in how we want to use it to improve things around us.
